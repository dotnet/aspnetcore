# API Review Conventions and Principles

Welcome to the API Review Conventions and Principles document for the dotnet/aspnetcore repository. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the conventions and principles that our team has established over time. It is designed to encapsulate our collective knowledge and best practices, ensuring consistency and quality in our API design.

The primary goal of this document is to provide a reference for our team and contributors, helping them to understand and apply these principles when proposing new APIs. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to foster a collaborative and informed API review process, ultimately enhancing the robustness and usability of our APIs.

We encourage you to refer to this document regularly and contribute to its evolution as we continue to refine our API review process. We also encourage you to follow the [.NET framework design guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/) for more general guidance not specific to the dotnet/aspnetcore repository.
