      Steps to reproduce the behavior.
      
      We ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a public GitHub repo.
      For a repro project, create a new ASP.NET Core project using the template of your choice, apply the minimum required code to result in the issue you're observing.

      We will close this issue if:
      - The repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.
      - If we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting.
      - If the repro project is attached as a `.zip` file.
      - If the GitHub repro project is set to `Private`.
