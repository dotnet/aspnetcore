# Select a pool provider based off branch name. Anything with branch name containing 'release' must go into an -Svc pool,
# otherwise it should go into the "normal" pools. This separates out the queueing and billing of released branches.

# Motivation: 
#   Once a given branch of a repository's output has been officially "shipped" once, it is then considered to be COGS
#   (Cost of goods sold) and should be moved to a servicing pool provider. This allows both separation of queueing
#   (allowing release builds and main PR builds to not intefere with each other) and billing (required for COGS)
#   Additionally, the pool provider name itself may be subject to change when the .NET Core Engineering Services 
#   team needs to move resources around and create new and potentially differently-named pools. Using this template 
#   file from an Arcade-ified repo helps guard against both having to update one's release/* branches and renaming.

# How to use: 
#  This yaml assumes your shipped product branches use the naming convention "release/..." (which many do).
#  If we find alternate naming conventions in broad usage these can be added to the condition below.
#
#  First, import the template in an arcade-ified repo to pick up the variables, e.g.:
#
#  variables:
#  - template: /eng/common/templates/variables/pool-providers.yml
#
#  ... then anywhere specifying the pool provider use the runtime variables,
#      $(DncEngInternalBuildPool) and $  (DncEngPublicBuildPool), e.g.:
#
#        pool:
#           name: $(DncEngInternalBuildPool)
#           demands: ImageOverride -equals windows.vs2019.amd64

variables:
  # Coalesce the target and source branches so we know when a PR targets a release branch
  # If these variables are somehow missing, fall back to main (tends to have more capacity)

  # Any new -Svc alternative pools should have variables added here to allow for splitting work
  - name: DncEngPublicBuildPool
