  <!--
    Test asset publication support intended for case where an asset is referenced in a single test project.
    References in more than one or two test projects would slow the build because each restore or publish
    operation gets unique (per-test project) global properties.

    Hook into Build target in addition to Publish (for Helix), RunTests (for Arcade), and VSTest (for dotnet test)
    because VS does not use a target when discovering or executing tests (examines test assembly instead). Need
    those targets too to ensure everything is up-to-date when executing tests.

      These are separate invocations to ensure Publish sees restored setup. Platform and PlatformTarget removals
      are to fix builds inside VS.

      When CentralizedRestore is true, skip restore here because test assets are already restored via the
      solution file. This avoids NuGet race condition where parallel restore of the same project causes
      "Cannot create a file when that file already exists" errors. See https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/7648
