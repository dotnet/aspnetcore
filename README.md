ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.

ASP.NET MVC in ASP.NET 5 includes support for building web pages and HTTP services in a single aligned framework that can be hosted in IIS or self-hosted in your own process.
