  Importing this file is equivalent to having:
    <PackageDependency Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Build" />
  ... except it's much more convenient when working in this repo, because it consumes the
  Blazor.Build targets/exe directly without needing this project to be packed into a .nupkg.

  This is only intended for use by other projects in this repo.
