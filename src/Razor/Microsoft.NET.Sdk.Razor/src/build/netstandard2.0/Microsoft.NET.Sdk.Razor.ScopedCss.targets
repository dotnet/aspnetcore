<!-- General description of the scoped CSS pipeline and its integration with static web assets:
* Scoped css files get discovered and put into a ScopedCssInput itemgroup.
* Any file with a *.razor.css extension gets processed as a scoped css file. That means two things:
  * A uniquely identifying scope attribute is generated for that file.
  * The file will be transformed to apply the unique scope to all selectors and a new file will be generated.
  * This new file along with the scope will be added to the ScopedCss itemgroup.
  * When resolving Razor inputs we will match RazorComponent items with their associated ScopedCss item by convention.
    * The convention is that the scoped css file will have to have the same full path as the razor file with the addition of the .css extension.
    * Users can define their own convention by adding their own ScopedCssInput item with the RazorComponent metadata on it.
      * This metadata will point to the item spec for a given RazorComponent (typically the path from the root of the project)
  * At this point, if a razor.css file doesn't have an associated RazorComponent it will be discarded and not included in the final bundle.
    * This makes sure that the scoped css pipeline and the components pipeline are as orthogonal as possible.
    * Computing the scopes will happen very early on the pipeline and it will generate all the input that the compiler needs to do its job
      independently.
* For web applications (Blazor webassembly and Blazor server) the main project is responsible for producing the final CSS bundle and making
  it available during development and production behind $(PackageId).styles.css
* For razor class libraries we will add the list of ScopedCss to the list of available static web assets imported by the project, the main project
  will then discover these assets and add them to the ScopedCss files to process in the final bundle.
* For packing in razor class libraries, the ScopedCss files will get processed and added as static web assets to the pack.

Integration with static web assets:
* The generated scoped css files will be added as regular static web assets to participate in the pipeline.
  * Generated scoped css files will have a unique extension '.rz.scp.css' that will be used by the pipeline to identify them as such.
* In razor class libraries these generated files will be packaged normally as part of the static web assets process and if bundling is
  not enabled would be normally accessible at <<StaticWebAssetsBasePath>>/<<RelativePath>>.
* When bundling is enabled (there's no actual way to disable it) all scoped css files from class libraries will be identified by looking
  at the list of static web assets and identifying the ones that have a .rz.scp.css extension.
  * Using the extension is useful as it allows for third party tooling to do alternative processing in an easy way, these files will be
    removed off from the list of static web assets when the default bundling is enabled, so they won't show up in the final output.

  This target is added to ResolveStaticWebAssetInputs which only gets called by the main application.
  This makes sure we only include the bundle file when we are processing an application for build/publish
  and avoids including it on razor class libraries.
  In the hosted blazor webassembly case, we want to include the bundle within the assets returned to the host, so we wire up this task
  to `GetCurrentProjectStaticWebAssetsDependsOn` so that contents are replaced and shared with the host application.

  Normally, _CollectAllScopedCssAssets will find all the scoped css files from referenced packages, class libraries and the current project. When _AddScopedCssBundles
  runs, it will remove all those static web assets and add the bundle asset.
  When _CollectAllScopedCssAssets runs as part of a hosted blazor webassembly app, only the current project and package assets are removed from the list of
  static web assets. If the host also decides to generate a bundle, there will be a bundle for the razor client app and another bundle for the host and they will
  contain some overlapping css.
  * The bundle for the client app will contain the transitive closure of the processed css files for the client app.
  * The bundle for the server app will contain the css for the referenced class libraries (transitively and the packages).
    * Users in this position can choose to remove CssScopedInput entries to avoid including them in the host bundle.

  For Blazor webassembly we want to trigger the bundling at the Blazor client level so that different applications can have self-contained bundles. For the most
  common case, the bundle for a Blazor app and its host should be identical modulo path comments on the bundle.

  If one single bundle is desired, bundling can be disabled in the Blazor application and the host will create a single big bundle file.
