    <!--
      This property is used by Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web to generate a web.config file with 'hostingModel="InProcess"'.
      When this package is referenced, it is set by default to InProcess, unless the user project contains
      a different value for this property, or DisableInProcessHosting == true.

      When AspNetCoreModuleHostingModel is empty, ANCM defaults to the reverse-proxy and out-of-process hosting model.

      This property is only supported on .NET Core web applications.
