/// The Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server package and associated configuration
/// execute the `dotnet getdocument` command at build-time to support build-time
/// generation of documents. The `getdocument` tool launches the entry point assembly
/// and queries it for a service that implements the `IDocumentProvider` interface. For
/// historical reasons, the `IDocumentProvider` interface isn't exposed publicly from
/// the framework and the `getdocument` tool instead queries for it using the type name.
/// That means the `IDocumentProvider` interface must be declared under the namespace
/// that it expects. For more information, see https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/82c9b34d7206ba56ea1d641843e1f2fe6d2a0b1c/src/Tools/GetDocumentInsider/src/Commands/GetDocumentCommandWorker.cs#L25.
